# Booklog 

This is a re-write effort - replacement for an ancient command line app i used to use - Readinglog.

While I need a new app, I might as well get acquainted with http4s, doobie, circe, cats-effect and whatnot

In theory the Postgres database could be created by running this one command (though I ended up not using it locally, so the docker-compose.yaml file could be out of date):

```bash
docker-compose up &
```

date started working on this thing: 2018-05-12
