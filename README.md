# Booklog

This is a re-write effort - replacement for an ancient command line app i used to use - Readinglog.

While I need a new app, I might as well get acquainted with http4s, doobie, circe, cats-effect and whatnot

The Postgres database can be created and pre-loaded with some data by running this simple command (provided you have docker running and docker-compose installed).

```bash
docker-compose up &
#later to stop/start
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
```
